> Synchronize Snapshot âš¡ and Safe{Wallet} backends for offchain signatures

The EIP-1271 is now supported for offchain signatures by both snapshot & [safe](https://help.safe.global/en/articles/40783-what-are-signed-messages) backends.

However, Snapshot is not pulling signatures from safe after having collected all required signatures. 
This script is pulling signed messages from safe and pushing them to snapshot, after a small transformation to validate the payload.

You can run this script as a cron job to keep your snapshot proposals up to date with the latest signatures, or run it manually after
you have collected all required signatures.

## Getting started

You can run the script on the fly with npx:

```bash
npx snapshot-safe-sync <address-or-ens>
```

The CLI accept an optional --rpc-url to resolve the ENS. By default, the script is using the MAINNET_RPC_URL env variable, and fallbacks on the the default rpc of `ethers`

```bash
npx snapshot-safe-sync <address-or-ens> --rpc-url <rpc-url>
```

Or call the function in a script:

```js
const { getDefaultProvider } = require('ethers');
const { syncBackends } = require('snapshot-safe-sync');

const provider = getDefaultProvider();

syncBackends('<address-or-ens>', provider);
```
Or, with a module import:

```js
import { getDefaultProvider } from 'ethers';
import { syncBackends } from 'snapshot-safe-sync';

syncBackends('<address-or-ens>', getDefaultProvider(process.env.MAINNET_RPC_URL));
```

you can set a RPC_URL to resolve the ENS. By default, the script is using the default rpc of `ethers`

> **Warning**
> The script is build only for mainnet.
